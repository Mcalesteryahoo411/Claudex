# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to Claudex are documented here. The project
uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for tagged releases.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Replaced Claude Code's native `claude --resume` shutdown instruction after
  interrupted and nonzero exits, while preserving the original exit status.
- Cleared account-scoped usage state before activating switched Codex
  credentials, preventing stale quota data from appearing for the new account.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- First-run package-manager bootstrap with automatic managed-file upgrades.
- Public npm packaging under `claudex-codex` with the `claudex` executable.
- Homebrew, Scoop, and WinGet distribution metadata and documentation.
- Versioned `.tar.gz` and Windows `.zip` release artifacts with SHA-256 sums.
- Release-asset automation and package-content validation in CI.

### Fixed

- Friendly model names in Claude Code's secondary footer without leaked SGR
  fragments such as `[1m`.
- Clear Codex rate-limit guidance instead of internal credential-pool cooldown
  messages when model access is exhausted.
- Reliable `claudex --resume` shutdown guidance even when agent or concurrent
  session logs are updated at the same time.
- Live Codex Desktop and CLI account-change detection, atomic bridge refresh,
  and automatic invalidation of account-scoped usage state.
