# Security policy

Claudex handles local authentication material and launches a loopback
compatibility service, so security reports are taken seriously.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest release and the `main` branch. Older
releases and unmerged forks are not supported. Before reporting a problem,
confirm it still exists on the latest release when it is safe to do so.

## Report a vulnerability privately

Do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability and do not include
real credentials in a reproduction.

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting form:

<https://github.com/BeamoINT/Claudex/security/advisories/new>

Include:

- the affected version or commit;
- operating system and shell;
- impact and realistic attack scenario;
- minimal reproduction steps;
- suggested remediation, if known;
- whether the issue is already public.

Replace all OAuth tokens, generated proxy keys, account IDs, paths, prompts,
and session IDs with placeholders. Maintainers will acknowledge the report,
investigate it, coordinate a fix, and credit the reporter unless anonymity is
requested.

Claudex is volunteer maintained. The project targets acknowledgement within
three business days, an initial impact assessment within seven days, and a
status update at least weekly while a validated report remains unresolved.
These are response targets rather than a support SLA. Disclosure timing is
coordinated with the reporter and may be delayed long enough to prepare and
ship fixes across every supported platform.

## Safe testing and disclosure

Good faith research is welcome when it:

- uses only accounts, machines, and data you own or are authorized to test;
- avoids privacy violations, service disruption, persistence, and accessing
  more data than the minimal proof requires;
- stops after confirming the issue and reports it privately without exploiting
  other users;
- follows applicable law and upstream provider terms.

The project will not pursue action against research that follows these rules
and makes a reasonable effort to avoid harm. This safe harbor statement cannot
authorize testing against third party systems or override their policies.

## Security boundary

Claudex:

- reads the standard local Codex file backed session;
- writes a minimal bridge credential into a mode restricted private directory;
- binds its compatibility service to `127.0.0.1` by default;
- generates a local 256-bit proxy key;
- downloads a pinned CLIProxyAPI archive over HTTPS and verifies its SHA-256
  digest before installation;
- stores only sanitized quota values in its usage cache;
- removes managed Codex routing and credential variables before native Claude
  model launches;
- keeps concurrent native Claude and managed GPT sessions in separate
  processes with separate provider environments;
- transfers Fableplan output through a private temporary file only after size,
  UTF-8, NUL byte, and nonempty validation, then removes that file when the
  workflow exits.

Claudex does not commit credentials, upload local session files, or print OAuth
tokens. It does not combine Anthropic and Codex credentials in one process or
copy a native Claude session into its managed GPT profile. The Fableplan text is
treated as untrusted planning guidance rather than executable configuration.
Claudex cannot secure a compromised machine, an unsafe fork, a manually exposed
proxy port, malicious task or plan content, or third party software outside
this repository.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the data flow and trust
boundaries.
