# Troubleshooting

Start with:

```text
claudex --auth-status
claudex --doctor
```

Do not paste real credentials, `auth.json`, generated proxy keys, prompts,
session IDs, or unsanitized private paths into an issue.

## `claudex: missing .../env`

The launcher is installed without its matching private configuration. Rerun the
installer from the latest release. Do not create a token by hand unless you are
developing a controlled custom installation.

## Codex is logged out

Run:

```text
claudex --login
```

Claudex uses Codex's official ChatGPT sign in. If `codex login status` succeeds
but no standard `auth.json` exists, `claudex --login` requests file backed
credential storage. Claudex does not scrape the OS keyring.

When a normal interactive Claudex launch detects that this session is missing,
it explains the problem, opens Codex's official browser sign in once, and
retries synchronization. CI, redirected/noninteractive launches, and background
recovery watchers never open a browser; use `claudex --login` interactively
before rerunning those jobs.

If the Codex CLI itself is missing, rerun the Claudex installer. It installs
Node.js/npm through a supported system package manager when necessary and then
installs OpenAI's official `@openai/codex` package into the user launcher
directory. Noninteractive installations never start a browser login; run
`claudex --login` afterward.

## Model is not advertised

Run `claudex --doctor`. The signed in account must advertise Sol, Terra, and
Luna. Sign into the intended Codex account, update Codex and Claudex, and try
again. Claudex will not silently map an unavailable model to a different one.

Temporary provider outages and cooldowns are upstream conditions. Claudex
bounds retries and agent concurrency to avoid turning them into retry storms.
The managed bridge retries transient upstream 500/502/503/504 responses before
Claude Code sees them, including failures before the first stream byte. A red
API error that remains after those bounded retries is a persistent failure and
is intentionally still shown.
When Codex reports an exhausted model quota, run `/usage-limit` to inspect the
reset window or select another signed in account. Claudex deliberately leaves
terminal and machine output byte for byte native, so the bridge's technical
cooldown wording can remain visible for a genuine quota exhaustion. If you sign
into another account in Codex Desktop or the Codex CLI, the running Claudex
session follows that account automatically; press Continue after the new
sign in completes.

## Native Claude model is unavailable

`--fable`, `--opus`, `--sonnet`, and `--haiku` use the installed Claude Code
CLI and caller owned Claude profile. Check the direct route without Claudex model
translation:

```bash
claudex claude --model fable --print "Reply with OK"
```

If the CLI rejects that alias or model ID, update Claude Code and verify the
Anthropic sign in, plan, region, and model entitlement. Claudex forwards exact
IDs through `--claude-model MODEL` but never substitutes another Claude model.
Codex authentication and `claudex --doctor` do not prove native Claude access.

## Fableplan does not start Terra

Fableplan fails closed when native Fable exits unsuccessfully or returns an
empty, oversized, invalid UTF-8, or NUL containing plan. Read the planner error,
then verify native Fable with `claudex --fable --print "Plan this task"`.
Fableplan requires one quoted nonempty task string. Terra does not start after
a planning failure, and the private transfer file is removed during cleanup.

## Local proxy does not become healthy

An open Claudex session automatically restarts a proxy that exits unexpectedly.
The recovery is shared across tabs and normally completes within the client's
bounded retry window. If `ConnectionRefused` persists:

1. Confirm no unrelated process is using port 8318.
2. Rerun the installer so the pinned compatibility binary and config are
   restored.
3. Check the sanitized logs under `~/.config/claudex/logs`.
4. Run `claudex --doctor` again.

Do not expose the generated proxy port to the network.

## `jq` is missing

Rerun `./install.sh`; it supports Homebrew, apt, dnf, yum, zypper, pacman, and
apk. If the package manager requires elevation, the installer uses `sudo`.

## The model picker has duplicates or stale labels

Close Claudex and start a new session. The launcher reconciles managed entries
in its isolated `.claude.json` on every launch. If the issue persists, update
Claudex and rerun the installer.

## The status line briefly shows no context percentage

A brand new session intentionally omits a zero value until Claude Code reports
real usage. During compaction, Claudex retains the last trustworthy value for
that session. It should never flash a misleading `0%` and then jump back.

## Usage limits are missing or stale

Run:

```text
claudex --usage-limit
```

If the live request fails, Claudex displays a recent sanitized cache when it is
within the configured maximum age. Check `CLAUDEX_USAGE_SOURCE`, network
connectivity, and Codex login. Selecting another account clears the old cache.

## Claude in Chrome does not connect

Use `claudex --claude-chrome`, not a model selector combined with `--chrome`.
The direct command intentionally uses the normal first party Claude profile.
Browser support, extension versions, subscription plans, and sign in are
controlled by Anthropic. WSL and unsupported Chromium variants may not work.

## Launch command remains visible or the terminal flickers

Confirm that the terminal supports alternate screen/fullscreen applications
and that accessibility or reduced motion settings are not forcing a different
rendering mode. Run the latest Claude Code and Claudex releases. Include the
terminal name and version in a sanitized bug report.

Claudex leaves interactive fullscreen cursor and redraw frames byte for byte
native. If the bottom input or status area is clipped after upgrading, close
the older running session and start a new `claudex` session so the updated
preload is active. On narrow terminals, the status line intentionally removes
lower priority quota and effort details rather than wrapping into the input
area.

## Windows script execution is blocked

Run the documented installer command from Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
```

This applies only to that process and does not change the machine wide policy.
If organizational policy still blocks scripts, consult the machine
administrator.

## Still stuck

Read [SUPPORT.md](../SUPPORT.md) and open the appropriate discussion or issue.
Include a minimal reproduction and sanitized `claudex --doctor` output.
