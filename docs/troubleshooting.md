# Troubleshooting

Start with:

```text
claudex --auth-status
claudex --doctor
```

Do not paste real credentials, `auth.json`, generated proxy keys, prompts,
session IDs, or unsanitized private paths into an issue.

## `claudex: missing .../env`

The launcher is installed without its matching private configuration. Rerun the
installer from the latest release. Do not create a token by hand unless you are
developing a controlled custom installation.

## Codex is logged out

Run:

```text
claudex --login
```

Claudex uses Codex's official ChatGPT sign-in. If `codex login status` succeeds
but no standard `auth.json` exists, `claudex --login` requests file-backed
credential storage. Claudex does not scrape the OS keyring.

## Model is not advertised

Run `claudex --doctor`. The signed-in account must advertise Sol, Terra, and
Luna. Sign into the intended Codex account, update Codex and Claudex, and try
again. Claudex will not silently map an unavailable model to a different one.

Temporary provider outages and cooldowns are upstream conditions. Claudex
bounds retries and agent concurrency to avoid turning them into retry storms.
When Codex reports an exhausted model quota, Claudex labels it as a rate limit
and points to `/usage-limit`. If you sign into another account in Codex Desktop
or the Codex CLI, the running Claudex session follows that account
automatically; press Continue after the new sign-in completes.

## Local proxy does not become healthy

1. Confirm no unrelated process is using port 8318.
2. Rerun the installer so the pinned compatibility binary and config are
   restored.
3. Check the sanitized logs under `~/.config/claudex/logs`.
4. Run `claudex --doctor` again.

Do not expose the generated proxy port to the network.

## `jq` is missing

Rerun `./install.sh`; it supports Homebrew, apt, dnf, yum, zypper, pacman, and
apk. If the package manager requires elevation, the installer uses `sudo`.

## The model picker has duplicates or stale labels

Close Claudex and start a new session. The launcher reconciles managed entries
in its isolated `.claude.json` on every launch. If the issue persists, update
Claudex and rerun the installer.

## The status line briefly shows no context percentage

A brand-new session intentionally omits a zero value until Claude Code reports
real usage. During compaction, Claudex retains the last trustworthy value for
that session. It should never flash a misleading `0%` and then jump back.

## Usage limits are missing or stale

Run:

```text
claudex --usage-limit
```

If the live request fails, Claudex displays a recent sanitized cache when it is
within the configured maximum age. Check `CLAUDEX_USAGE_SOURCE`, network
connectivity, and Codex login. Selecting another account clears the old cache.

## Claude in Chrome does not connect

Use `claudex --claude-chrome`, not a model selector combined with `--chrome`.
The direct command intentionally uses the normal first-party Claude profile.
Browser support, extension versions, subscription plans, and sign-in are
controlled by Anthropic. WSL and unsupported Chromium variants may not work.

## Launch command remains visible or the terminal flickers

Confirm that the terminal supports alternate-screen/fullscreen applications
and that accessibility or reduced-motion settings are not forcing a different
rendering mode. Run the latest Claude Code and Claudex releases. Include the
terminal name and version in a sanitized bug report.

## Windows script execution is blocked

Run the documented installer command from Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
```

This applies only to that process and does not change the machine-wide policy.
If organizational policy still blocks scripts, consult the machine
administrator.

## Still stuck

Read [SUPPORT.md](../SUPPORT.md) and open the appropriate discussion or issue.
Include a minimal reproduction and sanitized `claudex --doctor` output.
