# Installation

Claudex installs a small launcher and private configuration around Codex and
Claude Code. When either CLI is missing, the installer installs it from its
official distribution. Users do not manually create provider keys or configure
model endpoints.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Codex CLI | Supplies the user's ChatGPT/Codex sign-in; installed automatically when missing |
| Claude Code | Supplies the terminal UI and tool protocol; installed automatically when missing |
| Internet connection during installation | Downloads or updates dependencies and verifies the model endpoint |
| Supported account access | The signed-in Codex account must advertise the configured models |

The Unix installer also needs `curl`, `tar`, and a supported package manager if
`jq`, Node.js, or npm is missing. On legacy Linux distributions whose stock
repository is below Node.js 18, it installs a checksum-verified official Node.js
22 LTS runtime under the private Claudex config directory. The Windows installer uses built-in PowerShell
download and archive commands and can install Node.js through WinGet,
Chocolatey, or Scoop. Codex CLI is installed from OpenAI's official
`@openai/codex` npm package.

## Download

The shortest verified source installation is hosted on the Claudex website.

macOS, Linux, or WSL:

```bash
curl -fsSL --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://claudex.work/install.sh | bash
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://claudex.work/install.ps1 | iex
```

The website bootstrap verifies the latest stable GitHub release before running
its native installer. For package-managed installation, see
[package-managers.md](package-managers.md) for Homebrew, Scoop, and WinGet
commands. Package installs configure themselves on first use and refresh the
managed launcher after upgrades.

For the simplest verified source installation on macOS, Linux, or WSL:

```bash
curl --fail --silent --show-error --location --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 \
  --output /tmp/claudex-bootstrap.sh \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BeamoINT/Claudex/main/bootstrap.sh
bash /tmp/claudex-bootstrap.sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BeamoINT/Claudex/main/bootstrap.ps1 -OutFile "$env:TEMP\claudex-bootstrap.ps1"
powershell.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:TEMP\claudex-bootstrap.ps1"
```

The bootstrap resolves the latest GitHub release, verifies its SHA-256 entry,
rejects unsafe archive paths, confirms the embedded package version, and only
then runs the platform installer. To inspect or contribute to the source,
choose one of these methods instead:

1. Download the source archive from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/BeamoINT/Claudex/releases/latest) and
   extract it.
2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BeamoINT/Claudex.git
   cd Claudex
   ```

Release archives are preferable for ordinary users. A Git clone is convenient
for contributors and makes updates with `git pull` straightforward.

## macOS, Linux, and WSL

From the extracted or cloned repository:

```bash
bash ./install.sh --login
```

`--login` opens Codex's official ChatGPT sign-in and requests file-backed
credential storage. It is optional when `codex login status` already succeeds
and the standard Codex `auth.json` exists.

The installer:

1. checks required commands and installs `jq`, Node.js, and npm when needed;
2. installs Codex CLI from OpenAI's official npm package and Claude Code from Anthropic's installer when missing;
3. updates Claude Code on a best-effort basis;
4. downloads the pinned CLIProxyAPI archive and verifies its SHA-256 digest;
5. generates a random localhost-only proxy key;
6. creates private state in `~/.config/claudex`;
7. installs `claudex` into `~/.local/bin`;
8. opens the official Codex browser login when needed in an interactive terminal;
9. synchronizes the Codex login and runs `claudex --doctor`.

If `~/.local/bin` is not on `PATH`, add it to the shell profile:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Then open a new terminal and run:

```bash
claudex
```

## Native Windows

Open Windows PowerShell in the extracted or cloned repository:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1 -Login
```

The installer adds `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` to the user `PATH` and installs
the native PowerShell launcher plus a Command Prompt shim. Git Bash is not
required. Open a new terminal after the first installation so the updated user
`PATH` is visible.

## Verify the installation

Run:

```text
claudex --auth-status
claudex --doctor
claudex --usage-limit
```

`--doctor` must report a healthy loopback proxy and advertise Sol, Terra, and
Luna. If the account does not provide one of those models, Claudex exits with
an actionable error instead of silently substituting a model.

## Update

Claudex checks its stable release channel once per day without blocking startup
and applies updates by default. Inspect, check immediately, or apply immediately
with:

```text
claudex self-update --status
claudex self-update --check
claudex self-update --apply
```

Package installations delegate to their recorded package manager without
requesting `sudo`. Release-archive and source installs use an exact stable
GitHub release asset only after its version, checksum, and archive paths pass
validation. A failed or offline update keeps the installed release intact and
retries later with backoff. See [package-managers.md](package-managers.md).

For a Git checkout:

```bash
git pull --ff-only
./install.sh
```

On Windows:

```powershell
git pull --ff-only
powershell.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
```

For a release archive, download the latest archive, extract it to a new
directory, and rerun the installer. Existing private credentials and custom
environment entries are preserved. Replaced managed files are backed up under
`~/.config/claudex/backups`.

The separate Claude Code update check also runs every 24 hours by default. See
[configuration.md](configuration.md) to configure either update channel.

## Install on another machine

Install Codex and Claude Code, sign into Codex on that machine, download
Claudex, and run the platform installer. Do not copy `auth.json`,
`~/.config/claudex`, generated proxy keys, history, or session files between
machines. Re-authentication is safer and keeps each installation independent.

## Remove Claudex

Claudex does not modify the normal Claude Code profile. To remove it, first
close active Claudex sessions. Back up any intentional custom settings, then
remove the Claudex launcher and its private config directory:

```bash
rm "$HOME/.local/bin/claudex"
rm -rf "$HOME/.config/claudex"
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin\claudex.cmd" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin\claudex.ps1" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.config\claudex" -Recurse -Force
```

Removing Claudex does not uninstall Codex or Claude Code and does not delete
their normal profiles.
