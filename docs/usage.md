# Command reference

Claudex-specific launch switches must appear before the first Claude Code
argument. After the first forwarded argument, Claudex preserves every remaining
token literally.

```bash
claudex --terra --print "Explain this repository"
```

## Launch modes

| Command | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `claudex` | Start the Sol leader with auto permissions |
| `claudex --sol` | Explicitly start with GPT-5.6 Sol |
| `claudex --terra` | Start with GPT-5.6 Terra |
| `claudex --luna` | Start with GPT-5.6 Luna |
| `claudex --solplan` | Use Sol while planning and Terra while implementing |
| `claudex --manual` | Use manual permission handling for this launch |
| `claudex --auto` | Use auto permission handling for this launch |
| `claudex --accept-edits` | Automatically accept edit operations for this launch |
| `claudex --max-effort` | Pass Claude Code's native `--effort max` |
| `claudex --ultracode` | Enable session-only workflows with xhigh effort |
| `claudex --claude-chrome` | Use the normal first-party Claude profile with Chrome integration |

`--max-effort` and `--ultracode` are mutually exclusive. Explicit `--effort`
or `--settings` arguments cannot be combined with either shortcut because they
could silently override the selected mode.

## Model picker

Inside Claudex, use `/model` to choose a model. Claudex maintains exactly one
entry for each managed model:

- **GPT-5.6 Sol** — leader and hardest reasoning work;
- **GPT-5.6 Terra** — balanced implementation and substantial delegated work;
- **GPT-5.6 Luna** — fast search, triage, and bounded mechanical tasks;
- **GPT-5.6 Solplan** — Sol in plan mode and Terra during implementation.

Enter `/model solplan` as a shortcut for the built-in plan/execution selector.
Claudex does not activate plan mode merely because a task is large; plan mode
is reserved for explicit planning or a decision that must precede execution.

Model availability depends on the signed-in Codex account. `claudex --doctor`
shows what the local authenticated endpoint advertises.

## Authentication

| Command | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `claudex --auth-status` | Validate the shared Codex session and repair the local bridge if needed |
| `claudex --login` | Open Codex's official ChatGPT sign-in and synchronize it |
| `claudex --logout` | Log out through Codex and remove Claudex's bridge credential |

When Codex is logged out, Claudex clears its bridge rather than repeatedly
trying a stale credential. Sign in again with `claudex --login`.

## Usage limits

| Command | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `claudex --usage-limit` | Refresh and display detailed Codex limits |
| `claudex --usage-limit --cached` | Display the last sanitized snapshot without refreshing |
| `claudex --usage-limit --json` | Display the sanitized snapshot as JSON |
| `claudex --accounts` | List locally available Codex usage accounts |
| `claudex --account SELECTOR` | Select an account by number, email, or credential filename |
| `claudex --account auto` | Return to automatic newest-credential selection |

Inside an interactive session, `/usage-limit` displays the detailed report.
The status line refreshes a compact summary asynchronously. Selecting an
account invalidates the prior quota cache so values from different accounts
cannot be mixed. Changing the active login in Codex Desktop or the Codex CLI is
detected while Claudex is running; the local bridge follows the new account and
clears account-scoped usage state automatically. Disabled and expired
credentials are never selected.

## Claude in Chrome

`claudex --claude-chrome` intentionally bypasses the GPT compatibility path,
uses the user's normal first-party Claude profile, and adds `--chrome`. This is
the supported integration route for Anthropic's browser extension.

The first launch may request a Claude Code sign-in. Browser, account, and plan
requirements are controlled by Anthropic. The normal Claudex configuration is
not modified. Resume hints preserve the direct route:

```text
claudex --claude-chrome --resume SESSION-ID
```

## Claude Code passthrough

Unknown options and subcommands are forwarded in order. Management commands
such as `mcp`, `plugin`, `auth`, `update`, and `doctor` bypass the GPT proxy and
Claudex session injection. `--bare` and `--safe-mode` suppress the custom
leader prompt, agents, and default permission override.

Examples:

```bash
claudex --continue
claudex --resume SESSION-ID
claudex --worktree audit-branch
claudex mcp list
claudex plugin list
claudex update
```

See [claude-code-compatibility.md](claude-code-compatibility.md) for the tested
passthrough matrix and upstream limitations.

## Diagnostics

`claudex --doctor` reports:

- Claude Code and CLIProxyAPI versions;
- Codex authentication state;
- loopback proxy health;
- current model and model advertisement;
- permission, context, compaction, usage, update, and concurrency settings;
- platform rendering and profile isolation.

Doctor output never intentionally prints tokens. Sanitize account details,
local paths, and other private context before posting it publicly.
