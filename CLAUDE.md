# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Claudex is an open-source compatibility layer that lets Codex GPT models run through the Claude Code terminal interface. It reuses an existing local Codex login, runs a pinned, verified CLIProxyAPI binary bound to `127.0.0.1`, and launches an isolated Claude Code profile pointed at that proxy. It does not fork or patch the signed Claude Code executable — it is a launcher/wrapper, distributed as Bash + PowerShell scripts.

Production code is intentionally dependency-light: Bash, PowerShell, a small Node preload module, and JSON. There is no application build step or bundler.

## Commands

```bash
./test.sh                    # full Unix suite (runs test.zsh in an isolated fake home)
./test.ps1                   # full Windows suite (run from PowerShell)
npm test                     # check:docs + check:preload (no shell suite)
npm run test:all             # same as ./test.sh
./scripts/build-release.sh   # build release archives (tarball + Windows zip) into dist/
```

Focused checks (fast, no fake-home setup) before opening a PR:

```bash
node scripts/check-docs.mjs        # community-file + relative Markdown link validation
node scripts/check-preload.mjs     # preload.cjs integrity
node --check preload.cjs           # Node syntax check
bash -n claudex codex-session install.sh statusline usage-limit
zsh -n test.zsh
git diff --check
```

There is no single-test runner — `test.zsh`/`test.ps1` are one large suite of isolated regressions using fake homes and fake provider commands (Codex, Claude Code, curl, CLIProxyAPI) so tests never touch a real session. To narrow scope while iterating, grep the suite file for the relevant test function name and read it directly; there's no `--filter` flag.

CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) runs the Unix suite on macOS + Ubuntu, the PowerShell suite on Windows, and a `package-artifacts` job (`npm test` + `build-release.sh`) on Ubuntu, on every push to `main` and every PR.

## Architecture

### Request flow

```
user -> claudex launcher (Bash or PowerShell)
           |-- validates config and Claude Code capabilities
           |-- synchronizes Codex auth via codex-session
           |-- injects model aliases, limits, agents, status settings
           v
         Claude Code terminal UI
           v
         CLIProxyAPI on 127.0.0.1:8318
           v
         authenticated Codex account
```

### Components (Unix / Windows implementations kept behaviorally in sync)

| Component | Unix | Windows | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Launcher | `claudex` | `claudex.ps1`, `claudex.cmd` | Parse Claudex flags, negotiate Claude Code capabilities, configure the session, launch Claude Code |
| Installer | `install.sh` | `install.ps1` | Install dependencies, private config, launchers, verified compatibility binary |
| Auth bridge | `codex-session` | `codex-session.ps1` | Validate Codex login, atomically sync the minimum credential fields |
| Usage helper | `usage-limit` | `usage-limit.ps1` | Fetch, sanitize, cache, and display Codex usage limits |
| Status line | `statusline` | `statusline.ps1` | Render model, effort, stable context %, cached usage status |
| Terminal preload | `preload.cjs` | shared | Translate Solplan terminal input (`/model solplan`) without touching stdout/stderr |
| Settings template | `settings.json` | shared | Isolated default Claude Code settings written into the managed config |

Every shared behavior change must touch both the Bash and PowerShell implementation (`claudex`/`claudex.ps1`, `codex-session`/`codex-session.ps1`, etc.) — platform drift is treated as a bug unless the underlying OS genuinely lacks the feature, in which case the boundary must be documented, not silently emulated.

### Authentication lifecycle

Codex owns the actual login/logout UX. Claudex only verifies `codex login status`, reads the file-backed ChatGPT session from the standard Codex location, and atomically writes the minimum fields CLIProxyAPI needs into Claudex's private credential directory (restrictive permissions). A background watcher fingerprints the standard Codex credential file for the life of a proxied session and re-syncs on account changes, clearing any cached usage snapshot/account selection so stale-account data can't leak into the footer. Logout always tears down the bridge even if the upstream logout call fails.

### Usage-limit flow

The status line never blocks on network I/O — it reads a sanitized cached summary and triggers a bounded background refresh when stale. Detailed usage comes from the authenticated web endpoint, falling back to the Codex app-server `account/rateLimits/read` interface (fallback disabled while a specific bridge account is explicitly selected, since app-server may represent a different account). Identity/credential fields are stripped before any snapshot is written to disk.

### Context stabilization

Claude Code can emit zero/missing context data transiently during startup and compaction. The status line stores the last trustworthy context percentage per session and reuses only that session's own last-known value — never a false zero, and sub-1% usage renders as `<1%`.

### Update and compatibility strategy

At every launch, `claudex` reads `claude --help` and only injects flags Claude Code actually supports; unrecognized arguments are passed through unchanged. The installer does a best-effort Claude Code update; the launcher re-checks on a configurable interval without blocking startup, recovers stale lock directories, and avoids racing an explicit update command. The CLIProxyAPI dependency is pinned by version and SHA-256 per OS/arch pair and verified at install time — never vendored into the repo.

### Trust boundaries

- Trusted: repo-managed scripts, installed private config, standard Codex credentials, supported CLI flags.
- Loopback boundary: CLIProxyAPI binds `127.0.0.1` only, guarded by a generated local key.
- Third-party boundary: Codex, Claude Code, provider APIs, browser extensions, and CLIProxyAPI are separately maintained.
- Public repo boundary: no generated config, auth, prompts, history, sessions, or usage caches are ever committed. `~/.config/claudex` is fully separate from normal Claude Code state.

## Design rules (from docs/development.md — treat as binding)

1. Never modify the signed Claude Code binary.
2. Keep normal Claude Code state separate from `~/.config/claudex`.
3. Let Codex own login and logout.
4. Keep secrets out of arguments, logs, caches, tests, and Git.
5. Bind the compatibility service to loopback only; verify every downloaded asset's SHA-256.
6. Preserve unknown Claude Code arguments exactly (pass-through, don't drop or reinterpret).
7. Keep Bash and PowerShell behavior aligned.
8. Fail clearly when an essential upstream interface is unavailable — no silent degradation.
9. Add a regression test before considering a bug fixed.

Updating the CLIProxyAPI pin is security-sensitive: collect every macOS/Linux/Windows x64/ARM64 asset from the official upstream release, compute each digest independently, update both installers together, and run the full platform test matrix. Never replace a digest just to make a failed download pass.

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `claudex`, `claudex.ps1`, `claudex.cmd` | Cross-platform launchers |
| `install.sh`, `install.ps1`, `install.zsh` | Install and compatibility entry points |
| `codex-session*` | Authentication bridge |
| `usage-limit*` | Detailed and cached quota reporting |
| `statusline*` | Stable compact footer |
| `preload.cjs` | Byte-preserving Solplan terminal-input alias |
| `settings.json`, `env.example` | Reproducible configuration templates |
| `test.zsh`, `test.ps1`, `test.sh` | Isolated cross-platform regression suites |
| `scripts/` | `build-release.sh`, `check-docs.mjs`, `check-preload.mjs` |
| `bin/claudex-package.mjs` | package-manager bootstrap entrypoint (Homebrew / Scoop / WinGet) |
| `docs/` | User/maintainer docs — architecture, configuration, development, installation, troubleshooting, usage, compatibility matrix |

## Configuration model

The installer writes private runtime config to `~/.config/claudex/env`; `env.example` documents supported overrides (model aliases, permission mode, concurrency/retry limits, context window/compaction thresholds, usage-display cadence, proxy URL/token/binary path, auto-update behavior). See `docs/configuration.md` for the full variable table — don't hardcode defaults elsewhere without checking there first, since values like the default model ID or context window change between releases.

## Releasing

Maintainers release from a clean `main` after CI passes: bump `CHANGELOG.md` (Unreleased -> SemVer version, kept in sync with `package.json`), tag `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, push the tag, publish a GitHub Release, then update the Homebrew tap / Scoop bucket / WinGet manifest with the exact release-asset hashes.
